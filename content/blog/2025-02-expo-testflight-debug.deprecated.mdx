# Debugging Expo Apps in TestFlight

When your Expo app is running in TestFlight, debugging can be tricky. Here's a quick solution:

## The Problem

You can't use the standard Expo DevTools when your app is in TestFlight because it's a production build.

## The Solution

1. **Enable Remote JS Debugging**: Shake your device or use the gesture to open the developer menu
2. **Use React Native Debugger**: Connect to your device's IP address
3. **Check Logs**: Use `npx expo start --dev-client` and check the terminal output

## Alternative: Sentry

For production debugging, consider integrating Sentry:

```bash
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
```

This gives you crash reports and error tracking in production.

## Pro Tip

Always test your production builds locally before submitting to TestFlight:

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform ios
```
