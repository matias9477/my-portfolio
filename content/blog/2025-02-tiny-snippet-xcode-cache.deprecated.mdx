# Clearing Xcode Derived Data Cache

When Xcode builds start acting weird, clearing the derived data cache often helps.

## Quick Fix

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
```

Or use Xcode's menu:

1. **Xcode** → **Settings** → **Locations**
2. Click the arrow next to **Derived Data** path
3. Delete the contents of the folder

## Why This Works

Xcode caches build artifacts in DerivedData. Sometimes these get corrupted or out of sync, causing build failures or strange behavior.

## Pro Tip

Add this to your shell profile for quick access:

```bash
alias clear-xcode="rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData && echo 'Xcode cache cleared!'"
```
